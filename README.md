# Face Emotion Recognition (FER)

In this repo I implemented a simple CNN for face emotion recognition

## Dataset

I used **FER2013** dataset which is one of the most challanging datasets that contains approximately 30,000 , 48×48 images in 7 categories :

``` 
Angry = 0
Disgust = 1 
Fear = 2
Happy = 3
Sad = 4
Surprise = 5
Neutral = 6
```

you can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)

## Accuracy

the State of art of this dataset is around 75% accuracy and also winner model  had 71% accuracy and I reached ***63%*** accuracy in **train and validation sets** and  around ***62.7%*** accuracy in **test set** in 50 epochs.
it is considerable that **human-level accuracy** of this dataset is only at ***65±5%***
that shows our model has reached to the human level performance.
