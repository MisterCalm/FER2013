In this repo I implemented a CNN for face emotion recognition on FER2013 dataset which is the one of the most challanging datasets that contains images with 48×48 pixels.

the SOTA(State of art) of this dataset is around 75% accuracy and I reached 63% accuracy in train and validation sets and  around 62.7% accuracy.
it is considerable that human-level accuracy of this dataset is only at 65±5%
that shows our model has reached to the human level performance.
